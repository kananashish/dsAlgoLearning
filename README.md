# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey 🚀

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) journey! This repository serves as a journal to track my learning progress, challenges, and achievements as I dive deeper into the world of algorithms and data structures.

## 📚 **About This Repository**

In this repository, I will be documenting:
- **Solutions** to common DSA problems.
- **Explanations** and insights on various data structures and algorithms.
- **Code implementations** in Java (or any other languages I explore).
- **Practice problems** from online platforms (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.).
- **Optimization techniques** to improve time and space complexity.

The aim is to build strong problem-solving skills and better understand the trade-offs between different algorithms and data structures.
